Python scripts for scraping Wikipedia to find the most disliked YouTube videos over the past 4 years, and then convert data to an excel file for visualization purposes.

Wikipedia allows web scraping so long as the speed is not too fast. These scripts are run only one time and run at a speed far below the unacceptable threshold.
